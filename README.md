(1)samples:
	30 samples from normal distribution 1.
	70 samples from normal distribution 2.
(2)estimated parameters:
	The probability that samples come from two distributions.
	The expectation and the covariance matrix of normal distribution 1.
	The expectation and the covariance matrix of normal distribution 1.
